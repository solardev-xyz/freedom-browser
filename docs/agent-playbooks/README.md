# Agent Playbooks

This directory contains task-specific guidance referenced by `AGENTS.md`.

Use these files on demand:

- `architecture-boundaries.md`: guardrails for architectural changes.
- `code-style-and-linting.md`: lint-aware implementation workflow.
- `commit-messages.md`: commit title/body conventions.
- `changelog-process.md`: release changelog procedure.
- `security-checklist.md`: pre-commit and pre-PR security checks.

Keep `AGENTS.md` short and stable. Put detailed examples and process notes here.
