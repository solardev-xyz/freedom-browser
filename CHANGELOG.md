## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-08

First public open-source release.

### Added

- Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn to switch tabs, Ctrl+Shift+PgUp/PgDn to reorder tabs, Ctrl+F4 to close tab, Ctrl+Shift+T to reopen closed tabs, Ctrl+Shift+B to toggle bookmark bar, F11 for fullscreen, F12 for devtools
- Bookmark bar toggle that persists to settings and always shows on new tab page
- About panel with version, copyright, credits, website, and app icon
- DNS-over-HTTPS resolvers (Cloudflare DoH, eth.limo) for reliable dnsaddr and DNSLink resolution
- ESLint, Prettier, and EditorConfig for consistent code formatting

### Changed

- Split reload into soft (Ctrl+R, uses cache) and hard (Ctrl+Shift+R, bypasses cache); toolbar reload button defaults to soft, Shift+click for hard
- Switch IPFS content discovery from DHT to delegated routing via cid.contact

### Fixed

- Address bar staying focused after selecting autocomplete suggestion
